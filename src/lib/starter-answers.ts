    [allStarterQuestions[0]]: `To become a Software Engineer, you need a strong foundation in programming languages (like Python, Java, C++), Data Structures & Algorithms, and database knowledge (SQL/NoSQL). It's also crucial to specialize in areas like Frontend (React, Angular), Backend (Node.js, Spring Boot), and understand DevOps tools (Git, Docker, AWS). Building projects and getting internships are key practical steps.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[1]]: `To start in Cybersecurity, begin with IT fundamentals like networking (TCP/IP, DNS) and operating systems (Linux). Earn core certifications like CompTIA Security+ and CCNA. Gain hands-on practice with platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. Finally, specialize in an area like Ethical Hacking or SOC Analysis and apply for entry-level roles.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[2]]: `A Mechanical Engineer's career path starts with a B.Tech degree, focusing on subjects like Thermodynamics and Machine Design. Key skills include CAD/CAM software (AutoCAD, SolidWorks). You can then specialize further with an M.Tech in areas like Robotics or Automotive Engineering. Internships and practical projects are crucial for roles like Design Engineer or Robotics Engineer.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[3]]: `An AI Specialist focuses on building and training complex AI models and neural networks, often working on cutting-edge problems like natural language processing or computer vision. A Data Scientist has a broader role that includes collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to extract insights. While both roles use machine learning, AI Specialists are more focused on algorithm development, whereas Data Scientists focus on interpreting data to drive business decisions.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[4]]: `For Architecture, key subjects include Architectural Design, Building Construction & Materials, and Structural Engineering basics. You'll need strong skills in drawing, design software (like AutoCAD, Revit, SketchUp), and mathematics. The path involves a 5-year B.Arch degree, a mandatory internship, and getting licensed with the Council of Architecture (CoA) in India.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[5]]: `To become an Aeronautical Engineer, you first need to complete 12th grade with MPC. Then, pursue a B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering, focusing on subjects like Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics. Higher studies (M.Tech) allow for specialization in areas like UAVs or Jet Engines. Practical training through internships at companies like Airbus, Boeing, or DRDO is essential before starting a career as an Aeronautical or Aircraft Design Engineer.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[6]]: `A Biomedical Engineer designs and develops medical devices, equipment, and software to solve health-related problems. They work on a wide range of products, including artificial organs, prosthetics, medical imaging systems (like MRI and X-ray), and health monitoring devices. Their work combines principles from engineering, biology, and medicine to improve patient care and diagnostics.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[7]]: `A Civil Engineer's career path begins with a B.Tech in Civil Engineering, covering subjects like Structural Engineering and Construction Management. Key skills include software like AutoCAD and STAAD Pro. After graduation, they can work as Site Engineers or Structural Designers. Further specialization through an M.Tech or certifications in BIM can lead to roles like Project Manager in sectors like infrastructure, urban development, and government projects.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[8]]: `A BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) is an undergraduate degree that provides a broad foundation in business principles like marketing, finance, and HR. An MBA (Master of Business Administration) is a postgraduate degree for those who want to advance into leadership and management roles. An MBA is typically pursued after gaining a few years of work experience and offers deeper specialization and networking opportunities for executive-level careers.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[9]]: `To become an ML Engineer, you need a strong foundation in math (Statistics, Linear Algebra) and programming (Python). A B.Tech in Computer Science is a common starting point. You must master ML algorithms, deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and cloud ML services. Building projects like recommendation systems and doing internships are critical steps to land roles in e-commerce, finance, or healthcare.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[10]]: `The future of Biotechnology is very promising, with major growth in areas like Gene Therapy (correcting genetic disorders), Personalized Medicine (tailoring treatments to an individual's genetic makeup), Artificial Organs, and Stem Cell Research. There is also a huge focus on sustainable solutions in agriculture and environmental cleanup. This field lies at the intersection of biology, technology, and data science.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[11]]: `Graduates with an Electrical & Electronics Engineering (EEE) degree have diverse career options. Core electrical roles include Electrical Design Engineer and Power Systems Engineer. In the electronics sector, they can work as Embedded Engineers or VLSI Engineers. With the rise of Industry 4.0, new opportunities are available in Renewable Energy, Smart Grids, and Robotics. Further studies (M.Tech/MS) can lead to specialized research or government jobs.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[12]]: `A Paramedical Specialist provides essential healthcare services that support medical professionals. Their roles are diverse and include B.Sc. Nursing, B.Sc. Radiology (X-ray, MRI techs), BPT (Physiotherapy), and BMLT (Medical Lab Technologists). They perform diagnostics, administer treatments, and provide patient care in hospitals, clinics, and labs.`,
    [allStarterQuestions[13]]: `Data Science is a broad field focused on extracting insights from data using statistical methods and machine learning. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is more focused on building systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like understanding language or recognizing images. While a Data Scientist uses AI tools to analyze data, an AI Specialist builds those tools and models. Data Science is about analysis and prediction; AI is about automation and intelligent behavior.`,
